How SundarBan Could Be a Liability for Amazon:

1. Limited Global Scalability  
   - Relies on local payment gateways (bKash, Nagad), which don’t support Amazon's global reach.  

2. Redundant Operations  
   - SundarBan's systems might overlap with Amazon’s existing payment and logistics platforms.  

3. Integration Challenges  
   - Technical incompatibility with Amazon's platform may lead to costly migration. 
 
4. Political Instability
   - Political challenges, including demands for high commissions from local authorities, could raise operational and financial risks for a new foreign company.

5. Regulatory Issues
   - Compliance with Bangladeshi laws could increase legal and operational complexity.  

6. Reputation Risks  
   - Any service issues with SundarBan could hurt Amazon’s brand in Bangladesh.
